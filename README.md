This is our last project in Adalab, an intensive course of Front-End Development in Madrid. We have worked with [Triporate](https://triporate.com/), following the designs proposed by them. It's an intelligent platform that resolves all your company trip needs.

## Structure
We have used React.js for our project.
The first step to work with React is to check their official website and to follow the steps that they proposed:
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html
React is composed by different components. 
Our first big decision was to decide what would be our components architecture.
Once we took this decision we started working in the different steps of our project.

## Internationalization
We have followed the instructions of the following link to install the internationalization in our project:
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/setting-up-internationalization-in-react-from-start-to-finish-6cb94a7af725
Therefore our web app works in different languages: English and Spanish. It depends on your browser default language.

## Axios
In order to consume the API that we use in our project, we have used Axios.

## React-router
Our project is a Single Page Application (SPA) but we have used React router for navigating through it. Please, check out the next link if you need more help:

## CSS
To compile all of our CSS documents we have used a preprocessor called SASS.

Our team is very grateful to be able to work with an actual company in such an enthusiastic project
